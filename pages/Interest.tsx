                When I was a teenager, I dreamed of owning a surfboard when I
                grew up. Looking at my family’s situation, which could barely
                afford to send us to school, I downloaded images from the
                internet, printed them, and posted them on my wall. I still
                haven’t fulfilled that dream yet. I've always been a daydreamer,
                imagining myself exploring and traveling to discover different
                cultures. From this constant daydreaming before I sleep, I
                started thinking about a career that would allow me to live
                boldly, freely, and vibrantly while making a living. That’s when
                I discovered the field of IT. Now, I’m even more passionate
                about learning new technologies and aligning them with my
                personality, which seeks peace through my designs. I always aim
                to keep my designs minimalist and straightforward. Currently, I
                work on non-profitable projects as a collaborator with different
                teams. This helps me practice my front-end and back-end skills.
                I also enjoy learning to design databases using MySQL, but I’m
                much more confident working with front-end technologies. I love
                engaging in volunteer activities whenever I spot an opportunity.
                Besides these interests, what excites me the most is learning
                different languages and cuisines.
